## Successes and Challenges
Majority of the success on this project was being able to set up my databases with no issues. I found myself really enjoying mySQL and getting the foundation of the project going. I did have to do some research on Google to figure out what aliases are and how to implement them when I'm trying to combine data into one table. Another success was getting the functions view Departments, Roles and Employees to work, creating these functions and seeing them work the way they are supposed to with little trouble was very rewarding. A challenge I faced was creating the add a new role function because there was more data to find and input, I was getting stuck on selecting a department for the new role because I was getting a lot of undefined messages and eventually fixed this issue. Something that I also learned was that you have to pay attention to the input values that you have initially set up and making sure that you're entering the right format for that value.

## Future Development
I would like to edit the salaries in the future because based on what I have seen in the real world someone can stay in the same position for years and their salary could increase.

## Credits
I would like to give credit to my instructor Rommel and TA Ringo for teaching me how to use mySQL, my tutor Anothony for helping overcome some issues that I was encountering that involved merging data and Thomas Calle's repository and walk through video that I used to better understand the logic of piecing a project like this together.
